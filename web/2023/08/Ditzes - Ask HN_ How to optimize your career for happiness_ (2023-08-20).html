To be quite honest, you don't have to have passion for your job to perform well enough in accord with your salary and incentives. I'd say even more, overworking oneself is a "grave sin" against your future.<p>One's time and intelligence are better spent optimizing one's family size (in upwards direction) and health.<p>&gt; I thought I was already doing that but looks like I've been doing something wrong with my professional career, and there is a path more equilibrated and focused on happiness I should follow.<p>In addition to my advice, I recommend you to read this thread <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29581125" rel=nofollow>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29581125</a><p>Several things should be pretty evident by this point:<p>1. Software engineering sub-niches are grossly different in pay/effort ratio, overtime expectations and ageism prevalence<p>2. Overperforming expecting a raise is a poor strategy in most cases<p>3. Discrete option/bonus increase thresholds doled out according to perceived effort/visibility are a devious trick to lure a significant part of workers to invest more effort than they would otherwise (and still fail to get over the threshold to get the bonus). Don't fall for it.<p>And in any case: I think one of the most valuable things one can do is raise a big family, while investing into stock market and slowing down one's aging as much as possible, to reap all this compounding interest.</p></div></div><div id=item-29615004><div><blockquote>I'm mid-thirties working in Software/Data Engineering.

E.g., a lot of people want to want to get rich, but as you've discovered, more money doesn't actually leave them more fulfilled. If you're finding that hard to discover, a good therapist can help a lot, as talking with a lot of people lets them see patterns an individual can't.<p>Personally, I am also not great at telling when I'm stressed. So I've learned to look for obvious correlates. As an example, I am normally the sort of person who spends change. That is, I generally don't have more than $1 of coins, as I use them to make purchases. But when I'm stressed or depressed, I'm less likely to take the time to count out change, so I end up with an increasing number of coins on my dresser. That's a sign to me to ask what's wrong.<p>Also useful to me has been tracking the number of steps per week. I have a Garmin running watch I never take off. If I'm stressed, I'll become more sedentary. That's not just bad for my long-term health; it also decreases my resilience in the face of stress.<p>These things sound small, but they're useful to me as clues to the bigger things in life. If these indicators tell me I'm not doing well, I'll go down a mental checklist of things that could contribute. Am I sleeping enough? Eating well? How much alcohol am I drinking? How much sunlight am I getting? How do I feel before starting work? After the first couple of hours of work? At the end of the day? How are the important relationships in my life?<p>With that mindset, you can turn it into a debugging problem.

Thus I put lots of time into finding work that is interesting and has a lot to dig into.<p>I routinely annoy the institutions I work for because status and titles do not work for me. They are empty pursuits that hinge too much on the fickle perceptions of other people who may not share my values. My dream is to work for myself making software customers love. I have made some small steps[1] toward that this year, but replacing my current income will need a lot of work on the side, and that’s fine.<p>I’m playing a game of sorts, where I have a job I really like that is challenging and fits my goals as an individual contributor, whilst also dabbling in learning to make and sell things on the side. Both pursuits support the other, and I don’t have to win at either in order to feel “justified.”<p>This is just one way to approach the job issue.

I'm the same way: If I'm not learning and challenging myself intellectually on a regular basis, I end up depressed. Which isn't something society is very well set up for in my experience.<p>There are a couple of ways to proceed:<p>1.) Try to focus on career paths that allow you to learn/be happy. Going into research, returning to working at startups and accepting the stability limitations, etc. To do this, you want to look for positions where you learning directly helps the company. That way your interests are aligned.<p>2.) Decouple your intellectual life/happiness from your career path; whether this is possible depends on how much work demands from you. This is mostly what I do: I only work 20-30 hours a week in a non-tech job, so I have time to build terrible tech projects in my spare time + no pressure to learn or build for the sake of my career. I can just do whatever I want. It's very freeing, but of course, this has its downsides as well: I'm not well integrated into the tech community, for example.<p>Also consider that some of the stress may stem from your reliance on your career as well: Any situation where a single mistake/firing has devastating consequences results in stress. Minimizing this would involve building incomes, networks, etc. so you have a safety net.<p>Sedentarism, I can't help you, I'm reading the advice along with you, but that's my advice for happiness as somebody who prioritized doing work I like + makes the world better over money.</p></div></div><div id=item-29615397><div><blockquote>I'm mid-thirties working in Software/Data Engineering.

One additional thing to consider: why is your mind on stress from work?<p>How’s your marriage? How are your parents doing? Your kids? Who are some of your best friends?<p>How often are you physically active? Do you often go for walks, or play tennis, or garden?<p>How well are you sleeping? Do you love your mattress?<p>Any habits you’ve struggled to kick lately? Conversely, any hobbies you’ve really gotten into?<p>Personally, I’ve always noticed my personal happiness correlating MUCH more closely with the above than with work.

I had free Fridays and I would still end up sitting in front of computer all Friday, just doing something else not work... and back when I was freelancing "because that way I can work from anywhere", I've still spent like 99% of days sitting in my home office. In order to change the lifestyle one needs a bit of self-discipline to actually use the chances that they have instead of falling for the routine. If you don't want to live a sedentary lifestyle that just come up with things you can do to change it, like use a standing desk, make small breaks during the day to exercise, go to gym after work. Sticking to it is far harder than finding the time to do it.</p></div><div id=item-29615455><div><blockquote>any tips on how to find part time work?</blockquote></div><p>In my case, I just took a full time non-tech salaried job and used my tech skills to automate my duties or do them more quickly.

I'm usually performing quite well at my job, and easily get "special" attention and recognition which is good. At jobs, I tend to start motivated just by the work itself but at some point, after a few victories, recognitions, salary increases, or promotions I discover myself being that guy seeking attention and recognition and start feeling demotivated if I'm not getting it.<p>Perhaps, that's the big thing to solve. Being attention/recognition dependants doesn't look like being a good professional.</p></div></div><div id=item-29615903><div><blockquote>Happiness depends on a lot on what you truly want, as opposed to what you want to want, so I'd encourage you to get familiar with where those diverge. E.g., a lot of people want to want to get rich, but as you've discovered, more money doesn't actually leave them more fulfilled. If you're finding that hard to discover, a good therapist can help a lot, as talking with a lot of people lets them see patterns an individual can't.<p>Personally, I am also not great at telling when I'm stressed. So I've learned to look for obvious correlates. As an example, I am normally the sort of person who spends change. That is, I generally don't have more than $1 of coins, as I use them to make purchases. But when I'm stressed or depressed, I'm less likely to take the time to count out change, so I end up with an increasing number of coins on my dresser. That's a sign to me to ask what's wrong.<p>Also useful to me has been tracking the number of steps per week. I have a Garmin running watch I never take off. If I'm stressed, I'll become more sedentary. That's not just bad for my long-term health; it also decreases my resilience in the face of stress.<p>These things sound small, but they're useful to me as clues to the bigger things in life. If these indicators tell me I'm not doing well, I'll go down a mental checklist of things that could contribute. Am I sleeping enough? Eating well? How much alcohol am I drinking? How much sunlight am I getting? How do I feel before starting work? After the first couple of hours of work? At the end of the day? How are the important relationships in my life?<p>With that mindset, you can turn it into a debugging problem. E.g., if being too sedentary is one hypothesis as to why you're not happy, there's lots to experiment with there.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>+1 to therapy.<p>Specifically, a therapist that cares about your condition long-term. I went through a bunch of therapy apps with very transactional therapy sessions which didn’t get my anywhere. I eventually found a therapist I visit in person a few times a month who has numerous multi-year patients. It’s been an entirely different, enlightening experience.</p></div></div><div id=item-29615921><div><blockquote>I'd be interested to know what non-tech work you do.

I've struggled a lot. Everything is like broken. I'm still struggling right now. However, I'm still working on something to make our situation better. I do several research and experiments on Happiness, psychology, neuroscience and here are something I'm want to share.<p>+ Hedonic adaption: Hedonic adaption is special psychological effects that explains about how we perceive about happiness. Even after a big happy moment, our level of happiness do down quickly. We adapt our perception to our current situations. So it's like nothing will last forever. Hedonic adaption is both good and bad. It makes us adapt quickly with any situations. It keeps us safe. So we should appreciate it and learn how to make use of this effect rather than blaming it. Learns to attend with everything you do even it's bad, explore something news. It will help you deal with bad effects of hedonic adaptation.<p>+ Mindfulness: Do some mindfulness exercise. We feel stress because our mind think we're having problems. Our mind made up our feelings to keep us safe [7]. It's good for us. Mindfulness help us understand more about feeling and more enjoy the moment.<p>+ Mind body connection: Your health affects your mental, and your mental will affect your health. To me, it's not because some spiritual belief, but it's how systems work [3] [4]. Our body, our mind are systems. They are part of bigger system. They connect each others and interact with each other, sending some feedback. So try to improve both your health and your mental. Try to improve your health diet, do exercises and taking care of our thoughts and feelings.<p>+ We aren't rational. Our thinking system is optimal but it has limitations [3]. It has a lot of problems (cognitive biases). Learn to appreciate and find a way to make it better. For example, we can adapt. We update our belief overtime. Try to make new better habits[5]. Make small steps.<p>+ There isn't perfect things. Every systems aren't perfect. Our immune system, our cognitive system, organizations, data structures, design patterns,... Appreciate what works, what not and improve it.<p>Some interesting books, articles you might interest:<p>[1] <a href=https://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/hedonic-adaptation/ rel=nofollow>https://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/hedonic-adaptation/</a><p>[2] <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555 rel=nofollow>https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp...</a><p>[3] <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557 rel=nofollow>https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp...</a><p>[4] <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body-Pain/dp/0446675156/ rel=nofollow>https://www.amazon.com/Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body-Pa...</a><p>[5] <a href=https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits rel=nofollow>https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits</a><p>[6] <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being rel=nofollow>https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being</a><p>[7] <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Age-Anxiety/dp/0307741206 rel=nofollow>https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Age-Anxiety...</a></p></div></div><div id=item-29616039><blockquote>The special thing I’ve done is mostly being willing to sit with hard questions like “who am I” and “what do I really want out of life and a job?”, sometimes for years at a time (low-key).<p>The answer is always the same, and will probably always the same: I am motivated by mastery and autonomy.

Those that help others, like teachers and nurses. Their jobs can be stressful and not very financially rewarding. But they take satisfaction from seeing patients get healthy or students learn.<p>The other type are people who create things. If you are not of the first type I highly suggest that you find a career where you make things. Creating a software product definitely fits the bill for some people. But if you can't see what you are making because all you do is fix bugs, or work on small components, you might not get the job satisfaction you need. Seek out work that involves making things.</p></div></div><div id=item-29616046><div><blockquote>The special thing I’ve done is mostly being willing to sit with hard questions like “who am I” and “what do I really want out of life and a job?”, sometimes for years at a time (low-key).<p>The answer is always the same, and will probably always the same: I am motivated by mastery and autonomy.

Salary: we have a 2-person husband/wife micro-business so "it's complicated" but I pay us £5k GBP ($6.3k usd) p/m so that's ~$80k take-home p/a.<p>Working hours: absolute max 40 (although I'm taking a day off a week right now to do my own thing), very strict "no evenings or weekends" (apart from site launches and big deadlines of which there are about 3 a year), no work email on phone, long holidays (for example we take August off annually, and do it properly, no email, no phone, no client contact). I think probably I take 30-40 days holiday a year maybe? I don't actually count :-)<p>We've absolutely, 100% optimised for family. It started off as a semi-deliberate choice and then we moved to Cornwall (for a year, it made us happy so we stayed) and it became more and more clear that being in the now is the focus that makes us happiest. We have 2 teen kids, and we need to be in their lives for the short amount of time (18 years really does fly...) before they leave home and go do their own thing. I have friends who have risen through the ranks of their careers and now pull in anywhere from £150k-£1m++ but every single one of them leaves the house at 7, isn't back before 9 and does it 6 days a week. They employ people to look after their kids, they employ people to clean their houses, they don't know each other, the families are isolated from each other, the kids are fkd up, everyone drinks too much, everyone is intensely stressed all the time... There is absolutely no point, none whatsoever.<p>I could be dead tomorrow. It could be a speeding car, or a lump, or a mis-step or a stroke. So I try to maximise now. I'd rather have this time hanging out with my family than working (and I love my work - I just don't love it as much as my family!). I know that I'll probably be poor when I'm old, but to be able to eat a meal, sit and chat, go surfing with my kids and wife - I'd make that choice again a million times over.<p>So - finally - to answer your question. In my humble opinion (and yes, this is opinion, and yes, you have to have some luck - which I have had, at least so far - for these to work...):<p>1) There's no point in doing work that makes one unhappy. If you've got the choice (and most people do who are commanding north of $100k) then choose a lower salary which gives you more flexibility and life balance than a higher one that doesn't<p>2) Be in the now. It's all we've got. Sorry to be an old hippy, but it's true.<p>3) If you can, get a meditation practice going. If you can spare the time, extend this into a week long silent retreat every so often. These give (both) you time to recharge, to consider, to see life in context, to understand that there are bigger things at play than just you.<p>4) Be fit. It really helps.<p>5) Eat well. I'd go further with my opinion and say - be vegetarian - but at least minimise your meat consumption.<p>6) Be with the people you love. Maximise for this time. Everything will end - your life, your friends' lives, your social circumstance. Friends and family are literally the only thing that matters in the end, so make the most of them.<p>7) Do things that aren't anything to do with screens. Read. Listen to music. Be bored. Walk. Get a dog. Be away from that little rectangle of light for long periods of time.<p>8) Avoid debt if you possibly can. I'm not talking mortgages - they're pretty much inevitable - but if you can't afford a (luxury thing) then don't buy it, save for it. The people I know who are really, badly in trouble financially are the ones who see a thing and buy it on credit, then it bites them on the ass later.<p>Good luck out there.</p></div></div><div id=item-29616273><div><blockquote>Get a gym membership and go every day. If you have trouble going routinely sign up for classes or a personal trainer so you feel more obligated to go on a regular basis.</blockquote></div><p>Heh, that sounds like a nightmare for me personally. If going to an artificial place to get tired <i>every day</i> works for you, that's great, but this is not generally good advice. If it's purely about physical fitness (I'm really not quite sure what your goal with this method is, perhaps you could edit to clarify), going into nature to cycle or jog is much better due to the nature-happiness correlation (e.g. <a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916512451901 rel=nofollow>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001391651245190...</a> but there are many sources for this).</p></div><div id=item-29616280><div><blockquote>That's pretty good advice except for the part about kids.

If by "screwed" you mean anthropogenic climate change, then by now it's pretty obvious that it will be mitigated via some form of geoengineering (see, for example recent guardian's popularizing take on it: <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/30/geoengineering-by-gernot-wagner-review-a-stark-warning rel=nofollow>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/30/geoengineering...</a> )<p>To anyone who can look at the fertility curves and population pyramids, it should be pretty obvious that the real problem of the coming decades is demographic shift, and corresponding growth of dependency ratio. Compared to climate change, our authorities don't really propose a good solution for this crisis, except vague wording about more automation and more immigration (from the countries which, by they way, live through the same falling fertility curves).<p>If this reasoning still doesn't convice you, consider how hellish your own personal life is going be without grandchildren to take care of you. Western nursery homes staffed by min-wage workers speaking another language are not the place I'd wish for anyone to live in, but it's a de-facto place where grandparents of middle-class families are left to experience their final years.<p>In any case, I urge the readers to open the mentioned curves and statistical data and do the math to come to their own conclusion.</p></div></div><div id=item-29616293><div><blockquote>I'm mid-thirties working in Software/Data Engineering.

My happiest times in life were always marked by intense learning, and intense learning usually accompanies things that get labeled hard. Now, you don't do hard things because other people say they're hard; you do them because they're interesting to you and they push back when you dig in, causing you to need to bear down. In the process of that, then you start clawing back to beginners mind, and getting closer to be able to let this new thing reshape you in some small way. I love that feeling, it is like discovering a new conceptual world. Of course, it only makes sense if you're intrinsically interested in said thing, and willing to let it change you.<p>Stuff like virtual machines, interpreters, systems programming languages, Haskell, etc is all stuff I just wanted to know how it worked at one point, and I'd get sucked into more and more cool things to learn. I'm not a professional at all of those things (Haskell is a lifetime of learning) but I still enjoy them quite a bit, and have gotten a chance to use all of those professionally. Over time, they become competencies that are increasingly rare, so this has positive effects for future career choices.<p>Re: autonomy, I've always inferred this from my general attitude toward hierarchy, personality type, and watching myself across years and companies fail to be motivated at _all_ by the usual things that people seem to be motivated by. I feign interest in them and accrue enough of them to be reasonably autonomous, but I'm not going to be working weekends for months on end to beat other people at changing a word on my job title.<p>That's the type of thing that flows directly from knowing who I am. I don't need an upgraded title to hope to know who I am. I'm happy to receive it if it is given to me, but if it isn't; that's fine.</p></div></div><div id=item-29616340><div><blockquote>I'm mid-thirties working in Software/Data Engineering.

Maybe some of the are good, but I don't want to take the risk.<p>Become an expert in something. Make a substantial original contribution to knowledge in your field that advances the state of the art. This is actually an explicit requirement if you want to get a PhD, which I've found to be a valuable way of opening up fulfilling career opportunities that would otherwise not be available to me. Caveat: The process of getting there won't necessarily be a pleasant one, and some parts of academia can be just as toxic as corporate environments. I was pretty lucky in my experience with this.<p>Move to a country with a low cost of living, while working remotely for a company in the west. Your income will go a lot further, and you can use that to either support a more comfortable lifestyle or work only part time while still being able to support yourself.<p>Do something you're passionate about. I know this one is a cliche and lots of people will tell you it's unrealistic, but they're wrong.<p>Stay away from circumstances that cause you to descend into cynicism. It's very easy to become negative and give up hope when you're in a toxic environment, and if you find yourself in one than you need to escape. There are good companies out there run by people who have a clue and are genuinely nice to work with. Don't settle until you've found one.<p>Most people usually suggest making your children a priority, and not let your career get in the way of a healthy family life. Generally speaking they're correct. However if you don't already have kids, be aware that when the time comes you might suddenly discover that for medical reasons you are not going to be able to have them. If this happens to you, and you suddenly realise that all you have left is your career, you better be damn sure you've prepared in advance for this so you've got something to fall back on.

This is actually an explicit requirement if you want to get a PhD, which I've found to be a valuable way of opening up fulfilling career opportunities that would otherwise not be available to me.

Don't settle until you've found one.<p>Most people usually suggest making your children a priority, and not let your career get in the way of a healthy family life. Generally speaking they're correct. However if you don't already have kids, be aware that when the time comes you might suddenly discover that for medical reasons you are not going to be able to have them.

Don’t hustle out of constant fear you’ll be fired. Don’t answer the phone after 5. Work 40 hours or less. Work is a distraction from life; It isn’t life. Do as little of it as you need to, to achieve your financial goals. Have concrete financial goals. Don’t listen to fearmongering coworkers who have put themselves perpetually on call. If the company loses a customer because you don’t answer your phone, that’s on them not you. And they need to correct their staffing and expectations. Don’t be afraid to ask for more money. Don’t be afraid to quit and find another job. The overwhelming majority of your raises will come from changing jobs. Your company doesn’t care about you. It’s not a family. You’re there because they pay you to be. HR isn’t your advocate. Stock options are a lottery ticket, not a proper form of compensation. Practice being tolerant of some louder, younger engineer having loud opinions about how to do something because ultimately the way they do it wrong probably won’t matter much. Don’t obsess over software purity. If you need your code to be beautiful and elegant at all times, take up a side hobby instead.

Salary: we have a 2-person husband/wife micro-business so "it's complicated" but I pay us £5k GBP ($6.3k usd) p/m so that's ~$80k take-home p/a.<p>Working hours: absolute max 40 (although I'm taking a day off a week right now to do my own thing), very strict "no evenings or weekends" (apart from site launches and big deadlines of which there are about 3 a year), no work email on phone, long holidays (for example we take August off annually, and do it properly, no email, no phone, no client contact). I think probably I take 30-40 days holiday a year maybe? I don't actually count :-)<p>We've absolutely, 100% optimised for family. It started off as a semi-deliberate choice and then we moved to Cornwall (for a year, it made us happy so we stayed) and it became more and more clear that being in the now is the focus that makes us happiest. We have 2 teen kids, and we need to be in their lives for the short amount of time (18 years really does fly...) before they leave home and go do their own thing. I have friends who have risen through the ranks of their careers and now pull in anywhere from £150k-£1m++ but every single one of them leaves the house at 7, isn't back before 9 and does it 6 days a week. They employ people to look after their kids, they employ people to clean their houses, they don't know each other, the families are isolated from each other, the kids are fkd up, everyone drinks too much, everyone is intensely stressed all the time... There is absolutely no point, none whatsoever.<p>I could be dead tomorrow. It could be a speeding car, or a lump, or a mis-step or a stroke. So I try to maximise now. I'd rather have this time hanging out with my family than working (and I love my work - I just don't love it as much as my family!). I know that I'll probably be poor when I'm old, but to be able to eat a meal, sit and chat, go surfing with my kids and wife - I'd make that choice again a million times over.<p>So - finally - to answer your question. In my humble opinion (and yes, this is opinion, and yes, you have to have some luck - which I have had, at least so far - for these to work...):<p>1) There's no point in doing work that makes one unhappy. If you've got the choice (and most people do who are commanding north of $100k) then choose a lower salary which gives you more flexibility and life balance than a higher one that doesn't<p>2) Be in the now. It's all we've got. Sorry to be an old hippy, but it's true.<p>3) If you can, get a meditation practice going. If you can spare the time, extend this into a week long silent retreat every so often. These give (both) you time to recharge, to consider, to see life in context, to understand that there are bigger things at play than just you.<p>4) Be fit. It really helps.<p>5) Eat well. I'd go further with my opinion and say - be vegetarian - but at least minimise your meat consumption.<p>6) Be with the people you love. Maximise for this time. Everything will end - your life, your friends' lives, your social circumstance. Friends and family are literally the only thing that matters in the end, so make the most of them.<p>7) Do things that aren't anything to do with screens. Read. Listen to music. Be bored. Walk. Get a dog. Be away from that little rectangle of light for long periods of time.<p>8) Avoid debt if you possibly can. I'm not talking mortgages - they're pretty much inevitable - but if you can't afford a (luxury thing) then don't buy it, save for it. The people I know who are really, badly in trouble financially are the ones who see a thing and buy it on credit, then it bites them on the ass later.<p>Good luck out there.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Thank you for writing this, it really resonated with me. I’m moving back to Cornwall with my family after a stint working on the London grind to focus on our careers - I think there’s been some benefit to us doing that but Cornwall has always been where we wanted to raise our kids, so now we’ve got one and it’s possible we decided now is the time to do it! I can’t wait to get back, it really does feel like a different life there.<p>I think for us getting to the point where all of our needs are covered by our income, it’s been a learning curve to really experience that it doesn’t suddenly make you feel happy or fulfilled. It’s an absolute privilege to not be worrying about day-to-day living costs now, but I find there’s always something else to be worrying about, and easy to find yourself feeling like there just isn’t enough time to do what you really want to and not feel stressed.</p></div></div><div id=item-29617568><div><blockquote>Yes!

You will always be a cost center because some party school MBA can't factor you into an excel sheet.<p>1. Sprints are way to reduce you to a set of numbers and a stupid jira photo.<p>2.

Going completely remote saved about 2 hours a day from commute. This is big. This is not just 2 hours, but at the end of those 2 hours you won't be in a mood to do pretty much anything. I ended up working out for 30 mins and going on a long 90 min walk everyday. People tend to think 2 hours of physical activity is a lot and 'too much', but given how sitting oriented our jobs are - I don't believe this is the case. I don't even walk to get a lunch, once you wear a fitbit or some such device this becomes so clear how much of a sitting oriented life we have acquired. Also when I was monitoring weight, bp and other such parameters - nothing other than 2 hours made any dent. So 2 hours it is. Just wanted to add this perspective.

I go to my job, work my 40 (or less) hours, meet EXACTLY the requirements of my title, and go home with a clear conscience. I take 5 weeks of vacation per year and don't feel bad about it for even a nanosecond. I hardly program outside of work and I've, to be honest, never felt better.<p>Once you realize you're just a cog in a very expensive machine, a cost center to the people who decide raises, and the (especially if you're senior+) the first to get fired and replaced with foreign contractors, it becomes obvious the only solution is to use the industry to fund your talents rather than view it as a source of anything other suffering. I would estimate 70% of engineers say they enjoy their job. 10% of those engineers work for "fun" companies, and the other 90% are lying. So find something fun to do and <i>never</i> try to find some semblance of meaning to your job. There isn't any.<p>I used to work long weeks. 50-60+ hours "for the company". I rose to nearly staff engineer level before I was let go after so many empty promises. This happened several more times in my career.

The instant happiness I experience right now just from interacting with them already makes the responsibility worthwhile.<p>With time, I expect to get back some of the previous freedom and time, and, with that, the happiness it brings me, which should be an additive operation, pushing the overall happiness to a much higher level than the previous local maximum.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks for an amazing explanation that I feel can both reach someone who is not a parent through how it modifes the local maximum, but also verbalizes the feelings and "justification" for being a parent so well.</p></div><div id=item-29621232><div><blockquote>I'm mid-thirties working in Software/Data Engineering.

For me, that was a sign that I hadn't experienced or done enough different things to know what was missing from my life.<p>After my first startup job flamed out after going through several different roles and having similar feelings about feeling unfulfilled, I left, spent some of my savings _not_ working, and tried out tasks (some for myself, some for others; some paid, some not) in other fields that I thought I'd enjoy. When I hit on one, I pursued it as a career, at least briefly.<p>The end result wasn't me landing on my dream job, though over time I did apply and even get an offer for a couple, neither of which fully worked out either. What I learned was that a job in the definition of having a time when you come in and a time when you leave, a boss, a salary, benefits, none of that was fulfilling as a structure for my life.<p>Unfortunately, from where I'm born and live, and circumstances and consequences of my life, it's more difficult and expensive for me to live in a place where it's feasible ot escape that structure and survive. I make up for it by, unfortunately, working more — but by doing things I enjoy, for others, outside of that structure. I do those things on weekends or by taking PTO or even unpaid leaves to do it while retaining work that I don't love, but at least makes sure I can continue doing what I do if I get sick or need to support someone else.<p>I don't want to get into what that special fulfilling work is to me, because one thing I've learned about career advice is that each person's dream of labor is at some level nobody else's dream. And I want to emphasize that this is what worked FOR ME; some people ARE fulfilled by the structure, but not their tasks in it; some people aren't fulfilled by labor at all, and won't feel genuine fulfillment until they are no longer required to work. Even in my case, some people are fulfilled by freelance work where the structure is designed by you, others by entrepreneurship where your structure has to constantly adapt, others even by gig work some people consider to be too menial to justify any structure.<p>So for a "path more equilibrated and focused on happiness I should follow", to me at least, it's something that each person has to discover, and that it takes resources and privileges not everyone can afford. If you can, it also requires time and a willingness to be without a compass, a manager, or even any specific direction while you experience new things, meet new people, and learn about new opportunities and forms of creativity until you come across something that ignites that fulfillment in you.</p></div></div><div id=item-29621260><div><blockquote>Right, the thing is before you have children you can weigh the costs/rewards dispassionately, but after you have a child the calculus changes because now this person exists who is now the most important thing in the world to you.

If I had a kid tomorrow of course that equation would change and it would be in my best interest to rationalize all costs in service of the child, and surely I would and suddenly they would be "worth it." I do not view this as an argument in favor of having children, rather I view it as a a specific detail of the biological programming working its magic.<p>I'm not a never-kid person either.

But those are not the most important things in life. When it comes to writing one’s own love letters and blowing one’s own nose, “these things we want a man to do for himself, even if he does them badly.” This, argues Chesterton (in</i> Orthodoxy) <i>is “the democratic faith: that the most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselves – the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws of the state.”</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>In</i> What’s Wrong with the World, <i>Chesterton foresaw the dilemma of daycare and the working mother, that children would end up being raised by “professionals” rather than by “amateurs.” And here we must understand “amateur” in its truest and most literal meaning. An amateur is someone who does something out of love, not for money. She does what she does not because she is going to be paid for her services and not because she is the most highly skilled, but because she wants to do it. And she does “the things worth doing,” which are the things closest and most sacred to all of humanity – nurturing a baby, teaching a child the first things, and, in fact, all things.</i><p>&gt; <i>The line, “if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly,” is not an excuse for poor efforts.

Too many people seem to just automatically view work as soulless BS, to which I might suggest those people are simply in the wrong career.</p></div></div><div id=item-29641878><div><blockquote>Is this some sort of weird gotcha or are you sincere?<p>Joint damage is not really statistically correlated with long distance running, and anyone targeting a sub 20 minute 5k is going to have their weight and form so dialed in, it probably is barely a risk at all.</p></blockquote></div><p>I never progressed past 30km from hearing all of these people quiting to save their knees.

The personal training and coaching are the greatest expense and I will allow my lights to get turned off before I let that lapse - it's that important to me.<p>There has been a significant investment in a rowing machine, indoor smart trainers for cycling, and quite a bit of free weights. My wife runs, and she spends a healthy amount on running shoes.<p>There are monthly subscriptions for things like Trainerroad, Zwift, and "upscale" yoga. The yearly cost of all three might be $500.<p>I invest in a DEXA scan at least once a year for about $50. Workout clothes wear out and need refreshing, but we go cheap on that and the expense is minimal.<p>There are periodic expenses - a new Fitbit, or a heart rate strap needs to be replaced - but they are not frequent or costly.<p>There is a large upfront cost to all of this - I now mention the 2 pretty expensive road bikes we use, but they are years old and have more than paid for themselves by helping us attain better heart health - but it's not prohibitive.<p>I will also note that we have consciously chosen this route vs. maxing out 401(k) or similar. We are not wealthy (in the financial sense) nor are we sitting on a nest egg or in line to inherit a large sum of money.<p>Finally, we're not monomaniacal about fitness. We like good food, going to movies, socializing, and so on. We could do 3 nights in NYC for about $2500 - or we can skip that and use the money for new equipment or a trial run at, say, a new gym. We choose the later 9 times out of ten.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think if I'd have thought of these expenses as "buying physical fitness" I would have spent more.

I've been working at different companies during the last decade, and currently making ~$120k, and hitting no more than 40h/week.<p>I don't consider myself especially intelligent. Neither I'm dumb. I suffer from imposter syndrome from time to time, especially when I start a new job/challenge. I usually acknowledge these situations and manage to drive them without major problems. I have been in places where I was making way more but the job was boring, in startups where I was learning x10 every single day, I cut my salary to join especially talented teams, I stayed at places that required less than 10h/week while being paid for 40h... Sometimes I have been focused on pursuing a bigger salary, a promotion, or becoming a manager. I successfully accomplish most of these challenges. Every single situation had pros and cons, and none of them made me feel completely full-filled.<p>I thought I had a pretty good work-life balance but lately, I've been through health issues and every single doctor/therapist is pointing out to stress and sedentarism. Due to that, I've been reading some articles where researchers explain how people in tech started to care more about happiness and less about salary.

I started working for a mental health company this year that practices what they preach and it seems like something you might look into. Everyone odds always talking about mental health and psychology which is helpful and fascinating.</p></div><div id=item-29645160><div><blockquote>I agree with you about doing a job well. I just don't put the job at the top of my list in terms of where to focus my efforts.<p>Mind you, I'm not FAANG material nor the entrepreneurial sort. The feeling is mutual: I'm not interested in devoting my time to reach those heights in the workplace. They are not interested in hiring people like me. I don't apply for those jobs, and they don't try to recruit me. I'm sure the work is fine there but I can't see myself getting excited about it.<p>Now, let's talk about my FTP or VO2max and what I'm doing to increase my numbers. I'm really interested in my HRV and what factors affect it. I'm presently also interested in building an analog compressor - electronics are cool - and not at all interested in Tensorflow, deep learning, or spending my free time taking Coursera classes. Why would I spend time learning Rust when I can be improving my flexibility with some yoga? But that's just me.<p>And finally, I do get what I "deserve" on the job front: I'll always be a middle-of-the-pack guy and not a hot shot. I'm not lazy, but my ambitions are not in career advancement. So I get paid accordingly. But to me, a real hot shot is a 52 year old guy nailing a sub-20 5K.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think you're way overestimating "FAANG material" FWIW. At least at Goog there are a huge number of people that just do what they need to do and nothing more, don't respond to anyone or anything outside of normal hours and spend their time doing stuff with their kids / family / friends etc. Obviously these are not the people you hear about from outside Google, but if you work there then you work with many of them.</p></div><div id=item-29645175><div><blockquote>I never progressed past 30km from hearing all of these people quiting to save their knees.

People talk constantly about how great and fulfilling it is to help bring a child into the world, see it grow, teach it all the things you know, etc. What they actually mean is that it's very gratifying to have kids that are <i>yours</i> and <i>look like you</i> and <i>came from you</i>, because deep down we are all narcissists.<p>When you start talking about how they could have done literally all of those things by adopting any one of the bajillion kids that need it, most people will openly tell you that they would never consider it and don't feel even slightly hypocritical about it.</p></div></div><div id=item-29645693><div><blockquote>My understanding is that people destroy their knees in many ways over the course of their lives and that running makes that painfully obvious to them so they stop.</blockquote></div><div><p>I think its related to weight. We have to acknowledge that there is a serious obesity epidemic in the developed world. The majority of adults are overweight and obese. 
This is anecdata from what I've seen: you see fat runners. you see old runners. You dont tend to see many fat old runners.<p>The other thing is that if you dont regularly change your running shoes, you will absolutely hurt yourself.
